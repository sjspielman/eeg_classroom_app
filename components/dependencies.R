# Any packages that need to be added to renv that are not added automatically
# should get added in this file.
#
# For example, if you needed to include dplyr in renv, but there's no script
# or notebook that uses it yet you would put the following in this script
# (but uncommented):
#
# library(dplyr)
#

library(edfReader)
library(stringr)
